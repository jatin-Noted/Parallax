            <h2 class="secHead">Let's Dive into Adventure</h2>
            <p class="para"> Adventures are some of the moments in life, which makes our heart pump faster and gives us the feeling of being alive and full. It is an exciting experience very different from our normal daily routine. The adventure also brings with it a certain amount of risk. It brings thrill with it, and we can feel the wind rushing. Some people love adventures and live for them. Others use it as a means of escape from their normal lives. Whatever be the reason, adventure makes people feel great about being able to live those moments. <br>
            Activities like horse riding, bungee jumping, river rafting, parasailing, skiing, kayaking, paragliding, mountain climbing, freefalls etc. are called adventure activities. All of these activities also have a risk factor, but that is what makes them exciting. Adventure activities must be done under expert supervision, which will keep you safe in case of any emergency situation. Everyone should indulge in some adventure activity in their lives because we only live once.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">Cycling</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="para">Cycling is the best way to get in shape, enjoy the outdoors, and have fun while you’re doing it.  Unfortunately, many people think bicycles are for kids and often overlook the positive physical and psychological health benefits of cycling.  If you ride bike for thirty minutes every day, you would burn eleven pounds of fat in a year, build lean muscle, boost your metabolism, and dramatically decrease your chances of acquiring heart disease.  The immediate physical results of cycling will boost your self-esteem and you’ll find yourself wondering why you didn’t start pedaling down the road to good health sooner. <br>
            Cycling will relieve stress.  Modern American life moves at the speed of light and with our busy schedules it’s easy to become over stressed.  Mental stress adversely affects our emotional and physical wellbeing. </p>

                <h2 class="heading">Para Gliding</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="para">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'speed bag' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside. <br>
            Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.</p>

            <div class="bg bg3">
                <h2 class="heading">Surfing</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="para">Surfing is an exciting and casual sport that is performed by using a surfboard to ride breaking waves towards the shore. Typically, this is done on a beach. New advances in technology have now made it possible to surf on land with the help of a wave pool. When you think of surfing, California, Australia, and Hawaii tend to pop into people's minds. Though surfing is big in all three of these places, it is a fun activity that is practiced all over the world. Something to keep in mind that while surfing is a fun sport, it is also quite dangerous. The ocean is one of mother nature's wonders and is extremely hard to predict. <br>
            Now that you are informed on what surfing is and have a generalized knowledge of it, it is finally time to get started.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">Hiking</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="para">The word ‘hiking’ means a “journey on foot.” So, hiking means to walk or to tramp. And such walkers and trampers are found everywhere in the world. Some men are extraordinarily great hikers. Their main interest is hiking. They climb up the hills and mountains, walk along the banks of a river and tramp through the fields. There are many places for hiking. But the question arises-what are the benefits of hiking? Has hiking got any merit? Is it a good physical exercise? <br>
            First of all, hiking is a kind of physical exercise. While walking, the various limbs of our body move. Our legs, arms and other parts of the body are in motion. Therefore, it provides good physical exercise that keeps us physically fit.</p>

            <div class="bg bg5">
                <h2 class="heading">Rafting</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="para">Rafting is a sport in which rafters use an inflatable raft to race with other teams. The team that reaches the destination first wins the race. The racing is done on white water or rough water of different degrees. The rafters use double blades to paddle the boat. Rafting should not be confused with canoeing, kayaking, rowing or dragon boat because all these variants use different boats and they have different sets of rules. <br>
            This is a sport in which either an individual or a team can participate. Here one needs to race by rafting. Similarly other participants will also be chasing. The participant whose raft touches the finishing line first is declared as winner. Both men and women can participate in this sport.</p>
