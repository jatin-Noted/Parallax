                    <p class="para">The word "nature" can mean a lot of different things. All of the things you see around are part of nature. Nature grew and changed over billions of years to become what it is today. In other words, we can say that things that humans did not make are part of nature. People only changed the shape of things that were already there. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more.</p>

                    <p class="para">Nature gives all living things what they need to stay alive. It keeps life going and keeps the environment's ecosystem in balance. Without the help of nature, we would not be able to live. Nature gives us air, keeps us healthy, and keeps us alive. Everything we use in our daily life like the water we drink, the air we breathe, or the food we eat, is provided to us by the nature. We depend on nature for everything, and it gives us many things. Nature also helps us feel better and get away from the stress of everyday life. It keeps us from getting many diseases that can kill us. People who live near nature tend to be healthy and happy. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">Conservation of Nature</h1>
                    <p class="para">In order to conserve nature, we must take drastic steps right away to prevent any further damage. The most important step is to prevent deforestation at all levels. Cutting down of trees has serious consequences in different spheres. It can cause soil erosion easily and also bring a decline in rainfall on a major level. Polluting ocean water must be strictly prohibited by all industries straightaway as it causes a lot of water shortage. The excessive use of automobiles, AC and ovens emit a lot of Chlorofluorocarbons which depletes the ozone layer. This, in turn, causes global warming which causes thermal expansion and melting of glaciers. Therefore, we should avoid personal use of the vehicle when we can, switch to public transport and carpooling. We must invest in solar energy giving a chance for the natural resources to replenish.</p>

                    <p class="para">We have used nature in a lot of ways to make money. It is very important to know how important nature is and to treat it with respect. To ensure the well-being of future generations, we need to stop cutting down trees. Therefore, it’s time to work together to take care of nature, because if we want to save our planet, we need to protect nature. In conclusion, nature has a powerful transformative power which is responsible for the functioning of life on earth. It is essential for mankind to flourish so it is our duty to conserve it for our future generations.

Because of increasing demands for fuels like Coal, petroleum, etc., air pollution is increasing at a rapid pace.  The smoke discharged from factory units and exhaust tanks of cars is contaminating the air that we breathe. It is vital for us to plant more trees in order to reduce the effect of toxic air pollutants like Carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, etc. </p>
